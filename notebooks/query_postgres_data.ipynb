We had sold our house in the SF Bay Area with the intent of relocating back to the NW after 45 years of CA living. To say things had changed in those years would have been an understatement, when did Newcastle become a city, or all of these unincorporated areas garner names?! We were not sure when we came up here if we should buy at basically the top of the market, or rent for a period of time to see if the market cooled and prices came down. What this meant was even as we looked around at potential areas to live in, primarily the Eastside but also Pierce County (for housing affordability) we would think about places to rent as well. Jillian had the flexibility and patience to deal with our almost daily change of plans. Through it all she kept us focused on what we had provided as key “must haves” . We went to several houses Jillian gave us leads on, and she coordinated visits to houses we found and thought were good fits. The house we are in now was a place that she coordinated our viewing of as we were coming back from a visit to another house about an hour away. Thanks to Jillian, our new home met our needs, and has so many more attributes. We are in a house that we can age in (no stairs, single floor), upgraded kitchens and bathrooms, move-in condition,  a large flat backyard with minimal seasonal maintenance requirements but most importantly within 10 minutes of our first grandchild, the reason we were moving in the first place. Thank you Jillian and the staff at Pickett Street Properties for; as we used to say in business, meeting our specifications and exceeding our expectations.</td>\n",

Also there was a tenant that was procrastinating his move which required a lot of patience. Jesse helped take care of all upgrades and other necessities to make the sale go through seamlessly. And I got a better sale than the original listing!   \n",
       "44  Jillian Farrar was recommended to us by a family member, and it turned out to be the best partnership we could have imagined. We had sold our house in the SF Bay Area with the intent of relocating back to the NW after 45 years of CA living. To say things had changed in those years would have been an understatement, when did Newcastle become a city, or all of these unincorporated areas garner names?! We were not sure when we came up here if we should buy at basically the top of the market, or rent for a period of time to see if the market cooled and prices came down. What this meant was even as we looked around at potential areas to live in, primarily the Eastside but also Pierce County (for housing affordability) we would think about places to rent as well. Jillian had the flexibility and patience to deal with our almost daily change of plans. Through it all she kept us focused on what we had provided as key “must haves” . We went to several houses Jillian gave us leads on, and she coordinated visits to houses we found and thought were good fits. The house we are in now was a place that she coordinated our viewing of as we were coming back from a visit to another house about an hour away. Thanks to Jillian, our new home met our needs, and has so many more attributes. We are in a house that we can age in (no stairs, single floor), upgraded kitchens and bathrooms, move-in condition,  a large flat backyard with minimal seasonal maintenance requirements but most importantly within 10 minutes of our first grandchild, the reason we were moving in the first place. Thank you Jillian and the staff at Pickett Street Properties for; as we used to say in business, meeting our specifications and exceeding our expectations.   \n",

She was great to work with and made a potentially stressful process much more smooth and enjoyable. She was willing to go the extra mile and work quickly to secure our home in a competitive market. She has extensive experience and is knowledgeable about the intricacies of real estate transactions. I would 110% work with Jillian and the Pickett Street team again and would recommend them to anyone looking for a home in the Puget Sound region.   \n",

We liked his approach, being straight forward and we could tell he was very knowledgeable in the business.\\r\\nJesse and team were very well prepared and always available to take calls/texts and answer questions quickly.\\r\\nWe moved out of state before our house was on the market as Jesse put our minds at ease that he and team would take care of everything and they did!\\r\\nNo worry about cleaning carpets, etc while moving out as they had the house professionally cleaned, took care of staging set up (which was amazing), professional pictures along with two open houses. Our house was under contract within two weeks or so and this was at a time when the market was very unpredictable. We couldn’t have asked for a better team, thank you Jesse!   \n",

Not only did Jesse negotiate the best price for our home, he made the process seamless. We've already hired Jesse to sell one of our investment properties. I would highly recommend Jesse to everyone I know.   \n",
